======================================================
Design/Architectural Patterns and Decisions Used
1.  Spring Boot Framework:

      Chosen for its simplicity, ease of development, and wide community support.
      Provides built-in features for RESTful API development, dependency injection, and ORM integration.
2.  MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern:

      Used to structure the application into separate layers for better code organization and separation of concerns.
      Models (e.g., nextNumberEntity) represent the data entities.
      Controllers (e.g., nextNumberController) handle the API requests and responses.
      Services (e.g., nextNumberService) encapsulate the business logic and interact with repositories.
3.   Repository Pattern:

      Implemented using Spring Data JPA and JpaRepository to abstract the database operations.
      Allows easy database access and CRUD operations without writing explicit SQL queries.
4.   Transaction Management:

       Utilized the @Transactional annotation in the service layer to ensure that the entire operation (fetching the current value and updating the next value) is performed within a single transaction.
       Provides atomicity and consistency when updating the database.
5.   Unit Testing:

       Utilized JUnit as the testing framework for writing unit tests.
       Wrote tests to cover critical components such as service classes and repository methods.
       Used mocking frameworks (e.g., Mockito) to isolate dependencies and simulate database interactions during testing.
6.   Database:

       Configured the application to use a persistent database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store the numbers and category codes.
       Handled database connection and schema configuration using application properties.
7.   Error Handling:

       Implemented exception handling mechanisms to handle and return appropriate error responses for various error scenarios.
       Used Spring's exception handling capabilities to provide meaningful error messages to the API consumers.
